# üöÄ Magic Clipboard: Streamline Your Workflow with AI ü§ñ
# Unlock the Power of Automation with Your Clipboard!

**Magic Clipboard** is a feature-packed Windows desktop application that leverages the power of PyQt5 and OpenAI's API to monitor and process clipboard content effortlessly. Save time and enhance productivity by automating frequent clipboard operations.

## Update 
- 2024-8-8: üöÄüöÄüöÄSupport stream output now
- 2024-8-6: Added function edit button; added image clipboard and conversation feature; interface optimization

## Motivation

**1. Inspired by PowerToy keyboard**: The image below shows the PowerToy keyboard program, which supports processing clipboard text using GPT, but it requires the user to manually input the prompt for formatting every time. This can be inconvenient. MagicClipboard solves this problem by allowing users to predefine operations.

**2. Why use clipboard interaction:** For frequently used operations, such as translation, using clipboard interaction is more convenient and faster:

- Original workflow: The user wants to translate a sentence -> The user copies the sentence -> The user pastes it into an AI chat application -> The user inputs a translation prompt -> The result is obtained
- Clipboard interaction: The user wants to translate a sentence -> The user copies the sentence -> Clicks on the preset function (e.g., English to Chinese) -> The result is obtained

## Features

- **Clipboard Monitoring**: Automatically refreshes and displays the content of the clipboard.
- **Custom Functions**: Users can add custom functions to process clipboard content using specific prompts.
- **Model Selection**: Users can configure and select different models (as long as they are compatible with the OpenAI interface) for processing.
- **Configuration Management**: Users can configure and save API keys, base URLs, and model names for quick access.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
